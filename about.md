**WHAT?**

JumpStarts are <u>monthly problem-solving sessions</u> that employ guided group discussion (3hrs) to unpack and to solve a highly-focused <u>strategic/operational business challenge</u> — a challenge that must be practically resolved before the Featured Startup can progress to its next stage of sustainable growth.

<u>JUMPSTART SESSIONS</u>

*JumpStarts bring together*:

Founders of 1 Featured Social Startup (non-profit, for-profit, benefit corp., hybrid)
7 Expert Panelists
1 Goldilox Problem

<u>GOLDILOX PROBLEM</u>

Goldilox Problem = a focused Business/Change Model problem, neither too broad nor too narrow for a three-hour collaborative discussion.

GP Question Frames:
A Challenge to Overcome or An Opportunity to Seize: How do we solve or accomplish ___________?”
Choosing Between Alternatives: Should we pursue either Option A or Option B?

VALUE VALUE FOR FOUNDERS JumpStarts help the founders of promising Social Startups diagnose and address what is broken, missing, or under-developed in their Business/Change Models. The end-goal of the JumpStart session is to produce 3 Actionable Solutions for the Featured Social Startup. An 'Actionable Solution' describes a recipe-for-action: a sequence of discrete, executable steps. VALUE FOR EXPERTS JumpStarts bring together individual experts with their like-minded colleagues in order to collaboratively solve practical problems for social startups. But the greater payoff is the contribution made to a larger shared understanding within a growing network of Experts and Founders of how to build social startups that are uncommonly effective engines of change. PROCESS Throughout the JumpStart Process the emphasis is always upon the practical, real-world verification of all strategic/operational prescriptions and hypotheses. The goal is to not merely help individual social startups become more successful — the larger project is to develop an evolving Knowledge Base about how to best design and structure a 21st-Century Social Venture. 37hrs of Pre-Event Prep Key to the effectiveness of the JumpStart experience is the 37hrs of Prep Time that take place before the actual JumpStart. Across seven two-hour sessions (plus between-session homework), the Featured Startup’s Business/Change Model is systematically dissected, analyzed, and diagnosed. This rigorous analysis in turn produces a high-value Goldilox Problem: which seven Experts will then focus upon in order to produce three Actionable Solutions. Six-Months of Ongoing Support Post-JumpStart, the Featured Startup receives twice-monthly Support Sessions (2 one-hour sessions) to ensure continued progress in implementing and adapting the Expert Panel’s 3 Actionable Solutions. Outcomes Reporting Event Six-months later, the Featured Startup returns to the Expert Panel in order to report on Solutions Outcomes + Lessons Learned. The Featured Startup receives an additional 10hrs of prep support prior to the Outcomes Reporting Event. Case Study The entire six-month arc is captured and published in a Case Study that describes:

- What Worked?
- What Didn't?
- What Was Learned?
